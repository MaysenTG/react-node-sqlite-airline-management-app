Hey team, I wasn't able to figure out how to get Docker working for a ReactJS, NodeJS and SQLite app, but it is working as expected, and has most of the features when running locally.

To run the app:

1. Open the "client" directory, and run "npm install" (this installs npm packages for the react app)

2. Navigate to the root directory, and run "npm install" again (this installs npm packages for the NodeJS server)

3. In the same root directory as the step above, run "yarn dev" and both the client, and server will run.

Now, navigate to "localhost:3000" to navigate around the website :)
